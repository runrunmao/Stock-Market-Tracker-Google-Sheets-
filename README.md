## Project Overview

This project simulates a live dashboard used by financial analysts to track real-time stock performance. Built entirely in Google Sheets, it retrieves live equity data, applies intuitive formatting, and visualizes trends for a selected watchlist of tech stocks. Designed for portfolio monitoring, investor reporting, and executive briefings.


## Technical Stack

- **Google Sheets**  
- `GOOGLEFINANCE()` for data extraction  
- `SPARKLINE()` for mini trend charts  
- Conditional formatting  
- Custom number and percentage formats


## Core Functionality

### Real-Time Market Data Integration

- Watchlist includes tickers like META, AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, etc.
- Pulled real-time data using:
  ```excel
  =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price")
  =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "changepct")
  =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "volume")
  =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "name")

### Financial Reporting Formatting

- **Price**: USD with 2 decimal places  
- **Volume**: Shown in millions (e.g., `12.3M`)  
- **Conditional formatting** on `% Change`:
  - üî¥ **Red** for negative
  - üü¢ **Green** for positive (with reduced brightness)
  - ‚ö™Ô∏è **Neutral** for 0%

### Trend Analysis & Visualization

- **Fetched historical close data** (last 365 days):
  ```excel
  =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "close", TODAY()-365, TODAY())

- **Created in-cell sparklines for visual trend analysis**:
  ```excel
   =SPARKLINE(range, {"charttype", "column"; "color", "green"})
